This mod is built off of anuke(n)'s example mod. There are traces left from that mod in these files but they will not interfere.

Also there are remnants of the v5 version of this mod but they also will not interfere with the game (e.g the sectors being "zones")


CHANGELOG:

Update 1: added a ton of stuff, but some things aren't working properly
- the charged drill doesn't require power (it should)
- mineral water, red sand water and rubble all have the oh no texture
- both turrets do not work properly
- most custom items and blocks aren't even available due to there being no way to mine the required items
